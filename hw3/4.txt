                              and  want  to  have  a  physical  appearance  like  their  idol.  This  study 
                              aimed  to  examine  the  relationship  between  celebrity worship  and

                              Questionnaire-Appearance  Scale  (MBSRQ-AS).  Results  showed 
                              that  the  entertainment-social  aspect  of  celebrity  worship  proved  a 
                              significant  positive correlation  with  the  appearance  orientation 
                              dimension  of  body  image.  In  contrast, the  borderline-pathological 
                              aspect  had  a significant  negative correlation  with  the  body  areas 
                              satisfaction  dimension.  Nonetheless,  the  intense personal  aspect  of 
                              celebrity worship did not correlate significantly with all dimensions 
                              of body image among young girls fans of K-pop girl groups. Thus, 
                              each  level  of  celebrity  worship  correlates  differently  with  each 
                              dimension of body image. Entertainment-social is the most common 
                              celebrity worship among adolescent girls fans of K-pop girl groups 
                              and affects young girls' body image by increasing their attention to 
                              appearance.   


Introduction 
Adolescence is a transition period from childhood to adulthood, including physical, socio-
emotional,  and  cognitive  changes  (Santrock,  2007).  In  adolescence,  individuals  have 
several developmental tasks related to their physical and psychological maturity. One thing 
that must be fulfilled is that adolescents can accept their physical conditions. However, in 
reality, adolescents,  particularly  girls, possess  a  sense  of  dissatisfaction  with  their  body 
shape. Adolescents' dissatisfaction with their body shape increases from junior high school 
to senior high school and continues to increase until late adolescence and early adulthood 
(Bucchianeri, Arikan, Hannan, Eisenberg, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2013).  
        According  to Burns  (1993),  body  image  is  the  perception  of  an  individual  body 
shape. Each individual has the ideal body standard. Adolescent girls have body standards

that are more concerned with physical appearance and a proportional body shape (Denich 
&  Ifdil,  2015).  Body  image  consists  of  five  dimensions: appearance  orientation, 
appearance  evaluation,  body-areas  satisfaction,  self-classified  weight,  and  overweight 
preoccupation (Cash,  2000).  Appearance  evaluation  is  the  feelings  of  attractiveness  or 
unattractiveness  and  satisfaction  or  dissatisfaction  with  one’s  physical  appearance. 
Appearance  orientation  shows  how individuals  consider important  and  pay  attention  to 
their physical appearance and individual efforts to improve their appearance. Body-areas 
satisfaction focuses on individuals’ satisfaction with their specific body parts, such as face, 
chest,  stomach,  buttocks,  shoulders,  and  so  on.  Overweight  preoccupation  focuses  on 
individuals’ anxiety about fatness, dieting behavior, weight vigilance, and eating restraint. 
Self-classified  weight  is  an  individual's  perception  of  their  weight,  whether  classified  as 
underweight, normal, or overweight. 
      Factors that influence body image come from family, biological, media, and peer 
factors (Burns,  1993).  Media  is  one  of  the  most  influential  factors  in  body  image.  The 
media presents pictures of female figures' ideal body shape, which can affect the individual 
body  image.  The  negative  impact of  the  media  causes  individuals  to  overstate  the  ideal 
bodies so that individuals will always compare their body shape, go on a diet, and suffer 
from eating disorders. Body dissatisfaction in women increases when individuals compare 
their body shape with celebrities who possess slim bodies (Heinberg & Thompson, 1992). 
The psychological influence of the media gives rise to parasocial relationships with figures 
in the media. A parasocial relationship is a one-way relationship that the fans imagine with 
their idols that can influence adolescents’ behaviors (Giles & Maltby, 2004).  
    Lately, in Indonesia, the Korean wave or Hallyu phenomenon is frequently seen as a 
term for Korean fever related to the entertainment world of South Korea like films, dramas, 
music, fashion, food, and its traditional culture (Hennida, 2013). Korean pop or K-pop, an 
enormously popular genre of music from South Korea, is increasingly known in Indonesia. 
Adolescents  dominate K-pop  fans  in  Indonesia.  A  survey  conducted  of  100  K-pop  fans 
showed around 57% of respondents were in their teens and early adulthood (12-20 years 
old), 42% of respondents were 21-30 years old, and 1% were aged over 30 years (Nurani, 
2017).  The  K-pop  music  genre  is  well  known  for  both  boy and girl groups,  and  this 
research focuses on girl groups. Girl groups’ figures are often displayed with ideal body 
standards, such as having a slim body, tall, fair skin, thin face, and high nose, encouraging 
girl groups fans to look like their idols constantly. 
    The above phenomenon shows fans' admiration for their idols and illustrates a form 
of celebrity worship. Celebrity worship is defined as a parasocial relationship or one-sided 
relationship, which means that the individual knows about the celebrity but not the other 
way  around (Maltby,  Giles,  Barber,  &  McCutcheon,  2005). Maltby  et  al.  (2005) 
distinguish celebrity worship into three aspects according to its level: entertainment-social, 
intense-personal,  and  borderline-pathological.  Entertainment-social  is  the  lowest  level  of 
celebrity worship related to a celebrity’s ability to entertain and attract the attention of his 
or her fans. The intense-personal aspect involves a feeling that is intense and compulsive 
toward celebrities. Borderline-pathological is the most extreme level of celebrity worship, 
which is indicated by the willingness to do anything for a favorite celebrity. 
    Based on a previous study by Maltby et al. (2005), there was a significant relationship 
between the  intense-personal  aspect  of celebrity  worship  and  body  image  in adolescent 
girls.  Furthermore, a  study by Jung and Hwang (2016) among  female  college  students 
showed that attitudes toward favorite celebrities were positively associated with acceptance 
for cosmetic surgery, which is also a body image issue.

    The two previous studies of celebrity worship have not been conducted on fans of any 
particular celebrity. This study will examine the relationship between celebrity worship and 
body  image,  especially  among  young girls who  adore  K-pop girl groups.  In  contrast  to 
previous studies that examined overall body image, this study will examine the relationship 
between each level of celebrity worship and each dimension of body image. The researcher 
wants to explore the peculiarity of the relationship between each level of celebrity worship 
and each dimension of body image in young girls who are fans of K-pop girl groups. This 
study focuses on Korean pop girl groups as these groups are a very popular music genre 
among young girls in Indonesia today. 

Method 
This  study  used  a  quantitative  research  method.  Data  were  collected  online  using 
questionnaires, the Multidimensional Body-Self Relation Questionnaire-Appearance Scale 
(MBSRQ-AS) developed by Cash (2000), and the Celebrity Attitude Scale developed by 
Maltby et al. (2005). The researcher asked permission to use the Celebrity Attitude Scale 
(CAS)  and  the  Multidimensional  Body  Self-Relation  Questionnaire-Appearance  Scale 
(MBSRQ-AS)  from  the  authors  of  the  two  scales.  The  researcher  forward-translated  the 
two scales from English (the original version) into Indonesian and then back-translated into 
English to ensure that the Indonesian version of each scale had the same meaning as the 
original version. In addition, the researcher also asked for a Content Validity Ratio (CVR) 
assessment from the experts in psychology. According to Lawshe’s CVR (Wilson, Pan, & 
Schumsky, 2012), an item is said to have good content validity if the CVR Index is ≥ .5. 
The CVI values in this study were .900 for MBSRQ-AS and .890 for CAS. This study also 
used  an  open  questionnaire  to  explore  the  characteristics  of  the  participants.  A  set  of 
questionnaires  that the  experts  in  psychology  have  approved was  then  compiled  in  a 
google-form and distributed online. 
Participants 
Participants  in  this  study  were  recruited  online.  The  researchers  distributed  the 
questionnaire on the social media platform Twitter using google forms link through K-pop 
girl groups fans. Participants in this study were 414 female adolescents aged 18 to 22 years 
old and Korean pop girl groups fans. Table 1 shows the characteristics of participants.

Multidimensional Body-Self Relation Questionnaire-Appearance Scale (MBSRQ-AS) 
The MBSRQ-AS is a 34-item scale (Cash, 2000), but there were five items deleted in the 
current study because the item discrimination index was less than .250. This scale consists 
of five dimensions as follows. 

Tresna et al. (Celebrity worship and body image among young girls fans of K-pop girl groups) 
104                                                                       
                                                      ISSN 2598-6368 (online) / ISSN 1693-7236 (print) 
                                                                         

      The appearance evaluation dimension consists of 6-items. Examples  of items are 
“My body is sexually appealing” and “I like my looks just the way they are”. Each item is 
rated  on  a  5-scale  ranging  from  1  (definitely  disagree) to 5 (definitely  agree). The 
reliability coefficient for the current sample was .762, with the item discrimination index 
ranging from .296 to .683. 
      The appearance orientation dimension consists of 8-items. Each item is rated on a 
5-scale ranging from 1 (definitely disagree) to 5 (definitely agree). The sample of items are 
“Before going out in public, I always notice how I look” and “Before going out, I usually 
spend a lot of time getting ready”. The reliability coefficient for the current sample was 
.753, with the item discrimination index ranging from .342 to .581. 
      The body-areas satisfaction dimension consists of 9-items. Each item is rated on a 
5-scale  from  1  (very  dissatisfied) to  5  (very  satisfied). The  sample of items are “Face 
(facial  features,  complexion)” and  “Lower  torso  (buttocks,  hips,  thighs,  and  legs”. The 
reliability coefficient in  the current sample was .733, with the item discrimination index 
ranging from .261 to .657. 
      The overweight preoccupation dimension consists of 4-items. Examples of items are 
“I constantly worry about being or becoming fat” and “I am very conscious of even small 
changes in my weight”. Each item is rated on a 5-scale ranging from 1 (definitely disagree) 
to 5 (definitely agree). The reliability coefficient for the sample in this study was .804, with 
the item discrimination index ranging from .486 to .662.   
    The self-classified weight dimension consists of 2 items. Each item is rated on a 5-
scale  from  1  (very  underweight) to  2  (very  overweight). The  items  are  “I  think  I am 
very…..”  and  “From  looking  at  me,  most  people  would  think  I  am….”. The  reliability 
coefficient in the current study was .905. 
 
Celebrity Attitude Scale (CAS) 
The  CAS  used in  this  study  was  developed by Maltby  et  al.  (2005) and consisted of  22 
items. In  this  study,  the  items were modified  for  K-pop  fans  by  changing  the  word 
“celebrity” to “K-pop girl groups”. The items are rated on a 5-point scale with responses 
ranging from  1  (strongly  disagree) to  5  (strongly  agree). The  items of  this  scale  are 
categorized  into  three  aspects  according  to  the  level  of  celebrity  worship,  namely: 
entertainment-social, intense-personal, and borderline-pathological.  
      The  entertainment-social aspect measures  the  attitudes  and  behaviors of  fans  to 
their  favorite K-pop girl groups.  Examples  of  the  items  are “My  friends  and  I  like  to 
discuss what my favorite K-pop girl groups have done” and “I enjoy watching, reading, or 
listening to my favorite K-pop girl groups because it means a good time”. It consists of 10-
items.  The  reliability  coefficient  for the sample  in  this  study  was .797,  with the  item 
discrimination index ranging from .320 to .576. 
      The  intense-personal  consists  of  9-items.  Examples  of  the  items  are “When  my 
favorite K-pop girl groups dies, I  will  feel  like  dying  too”  and  “The  successes  of  my 
favorite K-pop girl groups are my successes too). The reliability coefficient for the current 
study was .820, with the item discrimination index ranging from .356 to .669. 
      The borderline-pathological  consists of 3-items.  An example of the item is “If  I 
were  lucky  enough  to  meet  my  favorite  K-pop girl groups and  they  asked  me  to  do 
something  illegal  as  a  favor,  I  would  probably  do  it”.  The  reliability  coefficient  for  the 
current sample  was .502,  with  the  item discrimination  index  ranging  from  .290  to .356. 
Alphas for the borderline-pathological tend to be lower because this aspect is the shortest 
of the three aspects, comprising few items (McCutcheon, Scott, Aruguete, & Parker, 2006).

Data Analysis 
The  collected  data  were imported  into  SPSS  version  24.0.  Spearman’s  correlation 
coefficient analyses were conducted to test the correlations between aspects of the Celebrity 
Attitude  Scale  (CAS)  and  dimensions  of the Multidimensional  Body-Self  Relation 
Questionnaire-Appearance Scale (MBSRQ-AS). 
      In  this  study,  the  data  distribution  is  not  normally  distributed  because  the 
significance value is less than .05. Therefore, hypothesis testing used a non-parametric test 
(Spearman correlation). The hypothesis is accepted if the significance value (p) < .05.

    Based  on Table  2,  the  correlation  value between  the entertainment  social  and 
appearance orientation was .108 with a significance value of .028 (Sig. < .05), which means 
a significant positive correlation between entertainment social and appearance orientation. 
The  significance  value  of  the  correlation  between  intense-personal  and  appearance 
orientation and borderline-pathological and appearance orientation were insignificant (Sig. 
> .05), which meant that the intense-personal and borderline-pathological aspects were not 
significantly correlated with the appearance orientation dimension. 
    The  correlation  between  borderline-pathological  and  body-area  satisfaction  is -.133 
(Sig.  < .05). This  result means  that  there  is  a  significant  negative  correlation  between 
borderline-pathological and body area satisfaction. The higher the borderline-pathological 
aspect,  the  lower  the  individual's  body  satisfaction,  which  means  the  individual  is 
increasingly dissatisfied with the size or appearance of some body parts. The three aspects 
of celebrity worship were not significantly correlated with three of five dimensions of body 
image: appearance evaluation, overweight preoccupation, and self-classified weight.

Discussion 
The present study aimed to test the correlation between the level of celebrity worship and 
dimensions of body image among female adolescent fans of K-pop girl groups. Of the most 
interesting findings was the significant positive correlation between the entertainment-social 
aspect of celebrity worship and the appearance orientation dimension of body image. Thus, 
adolescent  girls  who  adored  K-pop girl groups  for  their  ability  to  entertain  and  attract 
attention  would  place  more  importance  and  attention  on  their  appearance  and  strive  to 
improve the way they dress and groom. 
                                                                          

                      Tresna et al. (Celebrity worship and body image among young girls fans of K-pop girl groups)

      One  of  the  adolescent  characteristics  in  seeking  identity  is  idolatry. Greene  and 
Adams-Price (1990) suggested that adolescents chose a celebrity such as a pop singer to be 
their idol or role model. The appearance was one of the reasons adolescents admired their 
idols  which  caused  modeling  in  everyday  behaviors,  including  clothing  styles (Faujiah, 
2018). A study on South Korean female college students found that women made social 
comparisons  by  analyzing  the  appearances  in  the  media  and  making  judgments  about 
themselves (Choi, 2018). 
      The  finding  of  this  current  study  is  quite  in  line  with  the  result  of Noky  (2015) 
among  a  K-pop Community,  UCEE,  in  Solo,  which  showed  a  significant  correlation 
between the entertainment-social aspect  of celebrity worship  and body image. The main 
difference was that Noky (2015) examined body image as an overall concept consisting of 
appearance  evaluation,  body  areas  satisfaction,  anxiety  about  being  fat,  and  body 
categorization, while in this study, body image was examined separately based on its five 
dimensions.  Therefore, Noky  (2015) found  a  negative  correlation  between  the 
entertainment-social  aspect  and  body  image.  Whereas in  this  current  study, when  the 
entertainment-social aspect was only correlated with the appearance orientation dimension 
of body image, it turned out to show a positive correlation. 
      This study also found that the borderline-pathological aspect of celebrity worship 
had a significant negative correlation with the body-areas satisfaction dimension of body 
image.  The  borderline-pathological  aspect  is  such  an  extreme  level  of  celebrity  worship 
that it can encourage fans to do anything uncontrollably, including trying to have physical 
characteristics  that  resemble  their  favorite  celebrity (Maltby  et  al.,  2005; McCutcheon, 
Lange, & Houran, 2002). As a result, this type of worship could reduce the satisfaction and 
acceptance of K-pop girl groups fans  toward the size or appearance of their body parts. 
This  finding was  in  line with  a previous study (Kusuma & Yuliawati, 2013) which also 
showed  a  negative  correlation  between  the  borderline-pathological  aspect  of  celebrity 
worship and self-esteem because fans would do anything for their idols and imitate their 
idol behavior excessively.  
      The intense personal aspect of celebrity worship did not significantly correlate with 
all dimensions of the body image of K-pop girl groups fans. These findings were in line 
with Maltby et al. (2005), who found that the intense personal aspect of celebrity worship 
would  disappear  when  the  fans  became  more  mature. Maltby  et  al.  (2005) showed  that 
adolescent girls aged 14-16 years who had intense personal celebrity worship were more 
likely to have negative body image, but the correlation between celebrity worship and body 
image would fade in adolescents aged 17-20 years. However, a later study by Maltby and 
Day (2011) on  young adults aged 18-23 found a different result. The study showed that 
participants' intense personal worship toward celebrities whose bodies were admired would 
predict  elective  cosmetic  surgery  over eight months,  which  is  one  of  the  body  image 
problems. 
      The difference in the results of the two previous studies shows that the correlation 
between the intense personal aspect of celebrity worship and body image is determined not 
solely  by  the  fans'  age  but  also by  other  characteristics  of  the  fans.  There  were  several 
characteristics  of  K-pop girl groups fans  in  this  study  (see Table  1)  that  supported  the 
insignificant correlation  between  the  intense personal  aspect  and  all  body  image 
dimensions. Firstly, most of the participants in this study reported that although they often 
wished  to  have  bodies  like  idolized  K-pop girl groups,  the  frequency  they  compared 
themselves  to  K-pop girl groups  was  only  sometimes,  rarely,  and  even  never.   This 
characteristic indicated that the participants did not have a high intense personal aspect of 
celebrity worship. They did not report such intense and compulsive feelings towards their

favorite  K-pop girl groups, which did  not  correlate  with  their  body  image.  People who 
score highly on the intense personal aspect may be prone to causing worry or distortion in 
their body shape (Maltby et al., 2005). Secondly, most of the participants adored K-pop 
girl groups  not  only  because  of  their  attractive  appearance  and  face  (71.7%)  but  more 
because  of  their excellent vocals  (79.7%).  This  characteristic  also  indicated  that 
participants were not obsessed with the appearance of their favorite celebrity, which is a 
characteristic of the intense personal aspect, so this aspect was not correlated with the body 
image of the participants in this study. 
      All  aspects  of  celebrity  worship  did  not significantly  correlate  with appearance 
evaluation,  overweight  preoccupation,  and  self-classified  weight  dimensions  of  body 
image. These three dimensions focus more on the personal feelings and evaluation towards 
physical  appearance,  weight,  and  obesity (Cash,  2000).  The entertainment-social  aspect 
dominated  the  participants'  celebrity  worship  in  the  current  study (see Table  5). 
Participants focused  more  on  the  ability  of  K-pop girl groups  to  entertain  and  attract 
attention than merely physical appearance. Therefore, all aspects of celebrity worship did 
not  demonstrate a significant  correlation  with  the  dimensions  of  appearance  evaluation, 
overweight  preoccupation,  and  self-classified  weight.  Moreover,  some  characteristics  of 
participants in the current study (see Table 1) might also contribute to those insignificant 
correlations. These characteristics of participants include the length of worshipping K-pop 
girl groups, realistic  weight  perception, and  tendency  to  choose  healthy  weight  control 
behaviors when experiencing dissatisfaction.  
      Most  participants  had  worshipped  K-pop girl groups  for  more  than  2  years  (see 
Table 1). This quite long parasocial relationship might cause fans to have such a complete 
knowledge  of  their  favorite  celebrities.  This  knowledge  includes  their  songs,  relations, 
abilities,  and  even  personal  characters.  Their  admiration  was  not limited  to  their  idols' 
physical appearance and was not significantly correlated with their feelings or evaluation 
towards  physical  appearance,  weight,  and  obesity. One  of  the  reasons  most participants 
(71.7%) worshiped K-pop girl groups was that they have attractive appearances and faces. 
In addition, most participants also reported that they often and sometimes wanted a body 
shape like their favorite idol. Nevertheless, cross-tabulation between participants' BMI and 
the self-classified weight dimension (see Table 3) showed that most participants still had a 
fairly realistic perception of their weight. This participant's characteristic might support the 
insignificant  correlations  between  all  aspects  of  celebrity  worship  and  the  self-classified 
weight dimension. Another characteristic of most participants was the tendency to choose 
healthy weight control behaviors, such as exercising and reducing food portions, when they 
were  dissatisfied  with  their  bodies. This  characteristic  might  also  support  the  non-
significant  correlations  between  aspects  of  celebrity  worship  and  the  overweight 
preoccupation  dimension  of  body  image because  the  dimension contained  the  use  of 
unhealthy weight control behaviors, such as fasting or going on crash diets. 
      The  median  analysis  on  the  celebrity  worship  aspects  (see Table 5)  showed  that 
entertainment social was the most dominant aspect of K-pop girl groups fans in this study. 
Most of the participants reported that they always looked for information about K-pop girl 
groups they admired through social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram (see 
Table  1). Besides,  most  participants  also supported K-pop girl groups  by  always  or 
frequently listening to songs and streaming music videos, or providing direct support via 
the  V-Live  application. All  activities  related  to  K-pop girl groups  would  cause  the 
participants to pay more attention to their idols' appearance and increase their orientation

towards appearance. Adolescent fans of K-pop girl groups will pay attention and make the 
idols'  appearance  as  their  standard. Dewi,  Agustina,  and Faza  (2013) explained  that  the 
Korean  clothing  style  was  considered  attractive,  unique,  casual,  and  not  too  flashy,  so 
adolescents imitated their idols' dressing style. 
      The median analysis also showed that the borderline pathological aspect was at the 
lowest level compared to the other two aspects of celebrity worship (see Table 5). One of 
the characteristics of borderline pathological celebrity worship is the willingness to spend a 
lot of money on the goods related to their favorite celebrity (Maltby et al., 2005). Most of 
the study  participants reported  that  they never  and  rarely  bought  albums  and  goods  or 
merchandise of K-pop girl groups.  
      The limitation of this study was related to the characteristic of the google form as a 
data collection medium, namely the researcher could not directly observe the participants' 
accuracy in filling out the questionnaire. Consequently, the researcher had to abort some 
participants because they wrote the K-pop boy group's name. Another limitation lay in the 
validity of the self-classified weight dimension of body image, which only consisted of two 
items. Therefore, the discrimination index could not be calculated. Suggestions for further 
research is that research on the same topic can be carried out on male and female fans of 
K-pop girl and boy groups as a comparison. In addition, research on celebrity worship and 
body image can also be carried out using qualitative methods to collect more in-depth data, 
such  as  what  factors  influence  celebrity  worship  at  the  intense  personal  and  borderline 
pathological  levels.  Fans  of  K-pop girl groups  are  suggested  to  idolize  their  favorite 
celebrities  objectively  and  not  excessively so as not  to fall to the compulsive  and 
pathological levels of celebrity worship. 

Conclusion 
Each  level  of  celebrity  worship  has  a  different  relationship  with  each  body image 
dimension.  Entertainment social  is  the  most  common  celebrity  worship  among  female 
adolescents  fans  of  K-pop girl groups  and  affects  young girl'  body  image  by  increasing 
their attention to appearance. Borderline pathological is the most extreme and dangerous 
celebrity worship because it negatively  affects adolescent  girls' body  image by  reducing 
their satisfaction with some body parts. The theoretical implication of this research is that 
celebrity worship can indeed affect the body image of K-pop girl group fans, especially on 
the  dimensions  of  appearance  orientation  and  body  areas satisfaction. The  practical 
implication is that celebrity worship does not negatively affect the body image of young 
girls fans of K-pop girl groups as long as the adoration is expressed reasonably and not 
excessively (intense, too personal, and pathological).
