Abstract
Korean pop culture (K-Pop) has spread its influence outside of Korea to a worldwide
fan audience. The present study investigated the self-categorised K-Pop fandom
characteristics that predicted higher levels of K-Pop fanship, and subsequent psy-
chosocial outcomes. Social identity theory was applied as a theoretical framework. In
total, 1477 K-Pop fans from 92 predominantly Western countries fully completed an
extensive online survey measuring fanship, fandom and psychosocial outcomes (hap-
piness, self-esteem and social connectedness). Results of this study indicated that
K-Pop fanship was significantly predicted by a several K-Pop demographic and
fandom characteristics. K-Pop fanship was a significant predictor of increased hap-
piness, self-esteem and social connectedness. The study findings advance the appli-
cation of social identity theory in a K-Pop fan context and the psychological fanship
research more broadly.

Hallyu 2.0
The K-Pop wave, also referred to as the “Hallyu (한)”, is a music cultural
phenomenon involving the intentional spread of K-Pop (Korean popular
music) outside of Korea to the worldwide audience (Williams & Ho, 2014).

Since 2000, K-Pop artists such as BoA, Big Bang, SNSD (Girls Generation)
and SHINee were at the industry forefront of the Hallyu wave and had an
evident fandom in many countries outside of Asia (Jin & Yoon, 2016). In the
last months of 2012, one of the most notable K-Pop icons PSY released the song
and accompanying music video: ‘Gangnam Style’, which to the present day has
amounted to over 3 billion views on YouTube (Kim et al., 2014). According to
Billboard (2017), Gangnam Style remained in the American music charts for 122
weeks. In recent years, boy band BTS (also known as Bangtan Boys) dominated
the international music scene when their second album Wings became the high-
est US chart-topping and bestselling K-Pop album of all time (Billboard, 2017).

Artists like PSY, BTS and Red Velvet are internationally recognized K-Pop
idols who have demonstrated the extent of the popularity of K-Pop culture in
Western countries in recent years involving the use of various digital media
technologies. More recently, the involvement of emerging digital technologies
to the Hallyu wave has led to the coining of the new phrase: Hallyu 2.0 (Jin &
Yoon, 2016; Lee & Nornes, 2015). Hallyu 2.0 has been characterized by the
growing impact of K-Pop fandom in Western countries, ubiquitous multimedia
content (Kim, 2013), and the significant role of social media in K-Pop content
consumption (Jin & Yoon, 2016; Jung & Shim, 2013; Oh & Park, 2012).

With the growing number of K-Pop bands produced and promoted using
Internet technologies, it is difficult to accurately determine how many global
K-Pop fans exist in the world. Forbes (2019) estimated that BTS alone has in
excess of ninety million worldwide fans. The scope of K-Pop fanship is therefore
significant and worthy of scholarly inspection. In the subsequent sections, fan-
ship and fandom as psychological phenomena, are evaluated in the context of
the social identity of K-Pop fans.

The social identity of K-Pop fans
A psychological conception of a K-Pop fan can refer to an individual who is
loyal, enthusiastic, and an ardent admirer of K-Pop culture (Schroy, Plante,
Reysen, Roberts & Gerbasi, 2016). The social identity of a K-Pop fan is gener-
ally made up of their fanship and fandom (Reysen & Branscombe, 2010).

Fanship can be defined as an individual’s psychological attachment to their
fan interest (Schroy et al., 2016), whereas fandom can be defined as an individ-
ual’s psychological attachments to other fans who also share the same fan inter-
est (Reysen & Branscombe, 2010). Extensive psychological research into fanship
has been examined particularly in a Sport setting (Branscombe & Wann, 1991;
2274
Psychological Reports 124(5)
Gantz & Wenner, 1995; Hirt & Clarkson, 2010; Hurley, 2018; Reysen &
Branscombe, 2010) and in various digital media domains such as: celebrity
worship (McCutcheon et al., 2016), sports themed video games (Shafer &
Carbonara, 2015) and Anime (Ray, Plante, Reysen, Roberts & Gerbasi ,
2017). Fanship has been suggested as a fluctuating phenomenon (Schroy et al.,
2016) in the sense that an individual’s fanship intensity can change over periods
of time. Several psychosocial factors have been suggested as influences of fan-
ship fluctuations: an individual’s social identity (Reysen, Plante, Roberts,
Gerbasi 2015), gender differences (Pentecost & Andrews, 2010; Wann, 1995),
social connection (Chadborn et al., 2017), escapism (Wann, 1995) and sexual
attraction (Schroy et al., 2016).

Fandom can be a dynamic experience depending on the fan interest.

Typically, fandom has been associated with group identification (Ray et al.,
2017) and the ubiquity of the fan interest in society (Reysen, Katzarsca-
Miller, Nesbit & Pierce , 2013). Anime and Manga fans for example have
been known to attend and invest in their fan interest at conventions. In a K-
Pop context, Kim and Kim (2017) showed that K-Pop fans would regularly
engage with other fans in online K-Pop fan websites and groups specific to K-
Pop. Fanship and fandom may be distinctively different concepts as stated
above, but both concepts comprise as the components of an overall fan identity
(Reysen et al., 2013; Schroy et al., 2016), underpinned by self-categorisation and
group membership benefits.

It appears that K-Pop fans have a social identity comprising of K-Pop related
fanship and fandom. However, the psychological fanship extent of the K-Pop
fan identity remains largely unknown and is a fundamental component of the
Reysen and Branscombe (2010) fan social identity conception. The K-Pop fan
identity can be inspected in the context of an evidence-based psychological con-
struct underlined by how self-concept is influenced by group memberships and
affiliations. Social Identity Theory (SIT: Tajfel & Turner, 1979) posits that an
individual’s identity is made up of a personal and a social self by self-
categorization in groups. As a result of self-categorizing in a particular group
or set of groups, individuals then experience positive attachments to the in-
group of interest and contribute to intragroup morale (Kaye et al., 2019; Kim
& Kim, 2017; Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Individuals also report a variety of pos-
itive psychosocial outcomes such as perceiving fellow group members in a pos-
itive manner and fluctuations of self-esteem and self-enhancement, as a result of
self-categorisation (Tajfel & Turner, 1979).

SIT arguably offers possible insights into the development of the K-Pop fan
social identity. Taking a SIT perspective, K-Pop fans could consider their per-
sonal self with their K-Pop fanship, and their social self with their K-Pop
fandom. K-Pop fans have been known to self-categorize by creating, joining
and maintaining various online K-Pop fan groups ( Kim & Kim, 2017).

However, there has not been a substantial effort to investigate the psychosocial
Laffan
2275
extent of the self-categorisation behaviours that K-Pop fans execute. Contrary
to SIT assumptions, qualitative research into the K-Pop fan identity has sug-
gested that a pathological fan type exists called Sasaengpaen (Williams & Ho,
2014) who have been known to exhibit stalker-like behaviour (e.g. installing
CCTV on K-Pop artists’ property and writing letters to K-Pop artists in
blood) and an excessive fanship level. However this fan type is not representative
of K-Pop fans generally (Williams, 2016).

The present study
The overall aim of this study is to investigate the extent of K-Pop fanship on
attributed psychosocial outcomes using SIT as a theoretical framework. The
psychosocial outcomes of happiness, self-esteem and social connectedness
were assessed. The research question is stated as follows: To what extent does
K-Pop fanship significantly predict psychosocial outcomes attributed to K-Pop
fan group membership? Multiple regression statistical approaches have been
successful in demonstrating SIT to varying degrees in previous research (e.g.

Kalkhoff & Barnum, 2000). Thus, it can be hypothesized that K-Pop fanship
will be predicted by various forms of self-categorization, and that K-Pop fanship
will predict positive psychosocial outcomes. This study compliments the work of
Kim and Kim (2017) by further expanding on the implications of SIT in relation
to the extent of K-Pop fan self-categorisations and group membership
affiliations.

Method
Design and participants
The present study employed online questionnaires distributed in various online
K-Pop fandom groups such as: the R/K-Pop Reddit fan page, Facebook K-Pop
idol fan pages, fan community groups in the Amino Smartphone app, and via
Twitter fan group pages. The web link to access the study questionnaire was also
distributed to various Korean/Asian university societies in Ireland and the
United Kingdom via Email.

The participants were K-Pop fans (N ¼ 1477): Females (70.2%, n ¼ 1033),
Males (26.7%, n ¼ 393), Non-binary (1.8%, n ¼ 26), Transgender (0.7%,
n ¼ 11) and other genders/preferred not to say (0.6%, n ¼ 6). The average age
of a K-Pop fan was 23 years (SD ¼ 5, Age Range ¼ 18 - 55 years). K-Pop fans
accessed the survey in 92 different countries: United States of America (33.6%,
n ¼ 497), United Kingdom (9.3%, n ¼ 137), Philippines (6%, n ¼ 89), Canada
(4.9%, n ¼ 72), Ireland (3.2%, n ¼ 47), Germany (3.2%, n ¼ 47) and all other
countries collectively (39.8%, n ¼ 588).

Psychological Reports 124(5)
K-Pop fans listed to K-Pop everyday (59.4%, n ¼ 877), several times per week
(34.1%, n ¼ 503), once a week (3.5%, n ¼ 52), couple of times per month (2.6%,
n ¼ 39) and rarely/never (0.3%, n ¼ 4). The most popular K-Pop idol(s)/groups
were: BTS (44.8%, n ¼ 661), TWICE (9.7%, n ¼ 145), Big Bang (3.9%, n ¼ 58),
Red Velvet (3.5%, n ¼ 52), EXO (2.9%, n ¼ 43) and other idol(s)/groups collec-
tively (35.2%, n ¼ 518). However, many K-Pop fans reported to having multiple
favourite or most listened to K-Pop idol(s)/groups. The length of time partic-
ipants reported to have been K-Pop fans were: 1-3 years (37.1%, n ¼ 548), 4-7
years (22.6%, n ¼ 334), 1 year (18.1%, n ¼ 268), less than 1 year (18.3%,
n ¼ 271), 8-10 years (7.5%, n ¼ 111) and 11þ years (2.8%, n ¼ 41).

Measures
K-Pop fandom demographic questionnaire. Participants were asked about their
demographic information regarding age, gender, nationality, favourite K-Pop
idol/band, how long participants have been fans to their favourite K-Pop idol/
band, and how often participants listened to K-Pop music. Participants were
asked about the digital technologies (i.e. social media sites, music streaming sites
etc.) they use to listen to their favourite K-Pop idol/band. Participants were
asked about the fandom groups they are members of (i.e. Twitter pages,
Facebook private groups etc.), and the sites and sources they get K-Pop news
and information from (i.e. Korean media sites, K-Pop idol/band website etc.).

Participants were also asked about the K-Pop related events that were available
to them to attend (i.e. concerts, festivals etc.).

Fanship. K-Pop fanship was measured using the Fanship Scale (Reysen &
Branscombe, 2010). The Fanship Scale is a unidimensional 11-item self-report
scale measuring psychological fanship and was designed to facilitate any kind of
fan interest (Reysen & Branscombe, 2010). Sample items on the Fanship Scale
include: “I would devote all my time to my interest [my favourite/most listened
to K-Pop idol] if I could” and “I want to be friends with people who like my
interest [my favorite/most listened to K-Pop idol]” and all items are self-assessed
on a likert scale ranging from one to nine. The scoring procedure for the
Fanship Scale involves tallying up the item scores (one item is scored in reverse)
and interpreting the final score as a level of fanship. Higher scores are indicative
of higher fanship levels. In the present study, the Fanship scale adapted for K-
Pop fanship was highly reliable according to a McDonald’s Omega reliability
computation (11-items, x ¼ 0.88).

Happiness. Happiness can be conceptualized as a state involving frequent levels
of positive emotions, less frequent levels of negative emotions and a degree of
life satisfaction (Diener, 1984). Happiness was measured using the Oxford
Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ; Hills & Argyle, 2002). The OHQ is a 29-item
Laffan
2277
measure of general happiness self-reported on a likert scale. The scoring proce-
dure involves tallying up the item scores and dividing the total by 29. 12 items
are scored in reverse (e.g. “I don’t feel particularly pleased with the way I am”)
and 17 items are scored normally (e.g. “I find most things amusing”). Higher
total scores indicate higher levels of happiness. In this study, the OHQ was
highly reliable according to a McDonald’s Omega reliability computation (29-
items, x ¼ 0.81).

Self-esteem. Self-esteem can be conceptualized as an individual’s evaluation of
their own self-worth (Rosenberg, 1965). Global self-esteem was measured using
the ten-item Rosenberg (1965) Self-Esteem Scale (SES). The SES scored high in
internal consistency (a ¼ .84) in a recent media related study (Kaye et al., 2019).

The scoring procedure of the SES is to sum up the item scores on a four-point
likert scale with half of the items scored in reverse (e.g. “At times I think I am no
good at all”). Higher total scores indicate higher levels of self-esteem. In the
present study, the SES was satisfactorily reliable according to a McDonald’s
Omega reliability computation (10-items, x ¼ 0.79).

Social connectedness. Social connectedness refers to an individual’s subjective
awareness of being in close relationship with the social world as a whole (Lee
& Robbins, 1995). Social connectedness was self-assessed using the 20-item
Social Connectedness Scale-Revised (SCS-R: Lee et al., 2001). The SCS-R is
made up of ten positively phrased items (e.g. “I feel comfortable in the presence
of strangers”) and ten negatively phrased items (e.g. “I see myself as a loner”)
with corresponding standard and reverse scoring. The SCS-R is self-assessed on
six-point likert scale and higher scores indicate higher levels of global social
connectedness. Permission to use the SCS-R was granted by one of the scale
developers. The SCS-R was reliable according to a McDonald’s Omega reliabil-
ity computation (20-items, x ¼ 0.72).

Procedure
The present study underwent an ethics proposal and a series of pilot
testing before the final online survey was made accessible and distributed.

The survey link was strategically distributed into online fan community
groups, social media fan group pages, and via email to fan groups
whereby K-Pop fans could access the study in their own time. K-Pop
fans were asked to think about their favorite or most listened to K-Pop idol
(s)/group throughout and did not have to answer any question they did not wish
to answer.

Results
K-Pop fandom results
K-Pop fans (N ¼ 1477) used a variety of technologies to listen to K-Pop: online
video sites (e.g. YouTube: 97.2%, n ¼ 1435), social networking sites (e.g.

Facebook: 76.5%, n ¼ 1130) music streaming sites (e.g. Spotify: 76%,
n ¼ 1122), CDs/DVDs (41.6%, n ¼ 615), music collection sites (e.g. iTunes:
34.7%, n ¼ 512), K-Pop fan sites (e.g. AllKPop: 33.5%, n ¼ 495), K-Dramas
(e.g. Oh My Grace: 22.5%, n ¼ 333) K-Pop digital games (e.g. BTS World:
19.8%, n ¼ 293), artist website (e.g. bts.ibighit.com: 14.7%, n ¼ 217), and K-
Pop movies (e.g. Tazza 2: 8.3%, n ¼ 122).

K-Pop fans (N ¼ 1477) participated in several online fandom groups: Reddit
(e.g. r/kpop: 83.2%, n ¼ 1229), Twitter fan pages (46.9%, n ¼ 693), Facebook
(17.1%, n ¼ 252), artist fan sites (13.9%, n ¼ 206), WhatsApp groups (3.9%,
n ¼ 57) and Email groups (0.3%, n ¼ 5).

Most K-Pop fans did not attend any K-Pop related events (56.9%, n ¼ 840).

However, some K-Pop fans did report to previously attending K-Pop related
events: concerts (34.2%, n ¼ 505), conventions/conferences (8.5%, n ¼ 126), fes-
tivals (6.8%, n ¼ 101), offline meetups (6.4%, n ¼ 95), club parties (4.5%,
n ¼ 67), idol remembrances/memorials (3.8%, n ¼ 56), general themed events
(3%, n ¼ 45), workshops (1.6%, n ¼ 23), theatre shows (1.5%, n ¼ 22), and
cosplay events (1.6%, n ¼ 17).

K-Pop fans (N ¼ 1477) reported to getting their news and information about
K-Pop from several sources: idol/group social media sites (69.7%, n ¼ 1030),
web articles (69.3%, n ¼ 935), web forums (54.8%, n ¼ 809), bloggers (22.5%,
n ¼ 332), word-of-mouth (21.7%, n ¼ 321), vloggers (15.2%, n ¼ 225), Korean
TV (14%, n ¼ 207), Internet chat rooms (13.6%, n ¼ 201), Amino Apps (6.8%,
n ¼ 101) and Reddit (6.8%, n ¼ 101).

Demographic and fandom predictors of K-Pop fanship
Multiple linear regressions computed the predictor variables of K-Pop fanship
and psychosocial outcomes in the present study. Predictor variables were com-
binations of dichotomous categorical and continuous variable types. All predic-
tor variables input into the linear regression model scored low on
multicollinearity for fanship levels and psychosocial outcomes. Fanship data
were found to be normally distributed with a skewness score of - 0.15
(SE ¼ 0.06) and a kurtosis score of - 0.43 (SE ¼ 0.13). Descriptive statistics for
fanship data are displayed in Table 1.

Higher levels of K-Pop fanship were significantly predicted (R2 ¼ 0.306, F(7,
1434) ¼ 90.529, p ¼ .000) when K-Pop fans: were female (b ¼ 3.98, p ¼ .000),
listened to K-Pop every day (b ¼ 7.00, p ¼ .000), were younger in age

(b ¼ - 0.379, p ¼ .000), reported that BTS were their favorite or most listened to
K-Pop group (b ¼ 2.07, p ¼ .005), and were members of up to three online
K-Pop fandom groups (b ¼ 1.24, p ¼ .002). Notably, being a K-Pop fan for
more than 4 years was not a significant predictor of K-Pop fanship (b ¼ 1.13,
p ¼ .120).

K-Pop fanship as a predictor of psychosocial outcomes
K-Pop fanship was a significant predictor of all three psychosocial outcomes:
happiness (R2 ¼ 0.72, F(4, 1401) ¼ 27.19, p ¼ .000), self-esteem (R2 ¼ 0.021, F(4,
1349) ¼ 7.60, p ¼ .000), and social connectedness (R2 ¼ 0.12, F(4, 1406) ¼ 4.39,
p ¼ .002). Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics on K-Pop fan psychosocial
outcome results. Pearson correlation coefficients between fanship, happiness,
self-esteem and social connectedness are displayed in Table 2.

Discussion
The aims of this study were to investigate the K-Pop fandom self-categorisations
most associated with K-Pop fanship, and the extent of K-Pop fanship on attrib-
uted psychosocial benefits. The discussion of results is outlined subsequently.

Social identity theory in action
The results showed that K-Pop fanship was associated with increased psychosocial
benefits. In light of the study results, the findings can be deemed as contributory to
Kim and Kim (2017) for the advancement of the implications of applying SIT
(Tajfel & Turner, 1979) in a K-Pop context. Similarly to Kim and Kim (2017), K-
Pop fan self-categorisation was observed in this study. Self-categorisation was
evident when participants indicated their self-identification as a K-Pop fan via
categorical ‘yes/no’ options, and when participants indicated the extent of their
self-categorisation through their reported K-Pop demographic and fandom

characteristics. It is worth noting that this study found that the K-Pop fan indi-
viduals who belonged to up to three online K-Pop online groups were indicative of
higher fanship levels, yet as a whole, K-Pop fans generally reported a vast array of
K-Pop fan groups they belonged to. It could therefore be argued that the process
of K-Pop fan categorisation is complex and warrants further research scrutiny.

The results of this study showed that higher K-Pop fanship levels significantly
predicted increased levels of psychosocial outcomes (happiness, self-esteem and
social connectedness). Happiness in particular appeared to be most extensive pre-
dictor of K-Pop fanship compared to self-esteem, which is usually attributed most
to SIT (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Two potential explanations for this are: (1) that the benefits of digital technology play a positive psychosocial role across varying media
contexts (e.g. digital gaming) whereby SIT is inspected as a theoretical framework
(Kaye et al., 2019), and (2) global happiness and self-esteem are constructs that
may have overlapping conceptual components. In this study, happiness and self-
esteem were unidimensional constructs self-assessed with comprehensive measures.

Possible reasons for why K-Pop fan affiliation is associated with increases
across general psychosocial outcomes are: K-Pop may provide individuals with
a sense of belongingness in online K-Pop fan community groups ( Kim & Kim,
2017), K-Pop may be considered as an alternative to mainstream Western pop
culture (Jin & Yoon, 2016), and social media technologies (e.g. Reddit) may
provide K-Pop fans with a perceived increased sense of accessibility and con-
nectedness to their favourite K-Pop idols. However, exploratory qualitative
research could confirm or contest these possibilities. Therefore, it can be
argued that the study aim was generally achieved.

Implications for fanship
The results of this study may have novel implications for fanship research more
broadly. Listening to K-Pop music every day was found to be a fandom pre-
dictor of fanship, and as such, may provide new insight into the reasons why
fanship levels have been known to fluctuate over time. This result may suggest
Laffan
2281
that fanship is not solely determined by how long an individual has identified as a
fan over long term timeframe (i.e. being a self-categorised fan for a number of
years). Rather, this result may suggest that higher fanship levels can be deter-
mined by how often a fan invests psychologically into their fanship (i.e. listening
to K-Pop every day). This suggestion is further supported by a null result in the
current study whereby the length of time in years K-Pop fans reported to have
been fans was not a predictor of higher fanship levels.

The possibility that shorter term time constructs (i.e. listening to K-Pop
music every day, how many hours per day etc.) indicated higher fanship more
than longer term time constructs (i.e. being a K-Pop fan for over 4 years) should
therefore be further scrutinized in future fanship research. A longitudinal
approach measuring K-Pop fanship and its associated factors (Chadborn
et al., 2017; Pentecost & Andrews, 2010; Reysen et al., 2013; Schroy et al.,
2016; Wann, 1995) in intervals may confirm this implication. This research
therefore demonstrates a novel application of SIT (Tajfel & Turner, 1979),
particularly in relation to the extent of self-categorisation within online
groups. As such, the application of SIT in this study was beneficial for poten-
tially new advances for the study of psychological fanship. Other psychological
theoretical approaches may offer additional insight into the processes of K-Pop
fan self-categorisation. In this study, K-Pop fan categorisations were shown to
be predictors of K-Pop fanship to align with SIT assumptions (i.e. self-
categorisation resulting in psychosocial outcomes), however, the reverse (i.e.

K-Pop fanship as a predictor of K-Pop fan categorisations) may also be a pos-
sibility and compatible with SIT.

Strengths, limitations and future directions
Despite notable strengths such as the use of evidence-based psychosocial meas-
ures with strong internal validity and a large sample size inclusive of global K-
Pop fans, there are notable limitations worthy of mention. The multiple regres-
sion computations are correlational and do not imply causality rendering the
statistical ability as indicative, rather than causal. Despite regressions being able
to show associations between categorisations and psychosocial outcomes, it is
also worth noting that there were other compatible statistical approaches that
could have been applied e.g. structural equation modelling (SEM) and
mediation-moderation analysis.

The application of SIT as a psychological framework in this study also
presents a potential theoretical caveat, as the psychological process of how a
participant became a self-categorised K-Pop fan was not indicated in this study.

Fanship researchers have repeatedly reported this caveat as identifying the dif-
ficulties in understanding the dynamics of fanship over periods of time (Ray
et al., 2017; Schroy et al., 2016). Additional K-Pop fan categorisation consid-
erations worthy of inspection would be differences between K-Pop fan groups
2282
Psychological Reports 124(5)
(i.e. BTS fans and EXO fans) and K-Pop fan identity types (i.e. hard-core,
casual, and social fans).

In the broader fanship research context, future research investigations
into the motivations of fans and the subsequent implications of these fan moti-
vations on fanship, would arguably be a fruitful research direction. Fan moti-
vations may also provide additional insight into why fanship appears to
fluctuate over time (Schroy et al., 2016), and could be conveniently included
within a variety of research approaches (longitudinal, surveys and interviews
etc.) for psychological inquiry.

Conclusion
Fundamental psychological theories (i.e. social identity theory) can offer valu-
able insight into the psychological aspects of K-Pop fan behavior. This could
imply that K-Pop may become a topical avenue of research for psychology
researchers. Cyberpsychology, a field devoted to the intersection of psycholog-
ical thought and the application of digital technologies, may provide additional
perspectives into the role of the Hallyu 2.0 (Jin & Yoon, 2016) and K-Pop fan
behaviour more comprehensively. In the meantime, K-Pop continues to
